## About
    
senior software engineer, currently working at GE Vernova. I have skills and most experience working on `high-performance`,`distributed microservices` running in `kubernetes` clusters and `docker` containers. C++ and Java are my primary languages. I am also desperately addicted to coffee (professionally, of course), with the Chemex being my preferred brewing method.

outside of the professional space: a digital and privacy rights, OSS advocate, transhumanist, and an avid enjoyer of video games. I can also be found playing `dnd`, `world of warcraft`, `cult of the lamb` and `warhammer` (usually 40k tabletop). additionally, I tend to alsoread a number of books, mostly on philosophies and scifi (my favorite being `Dune`). I actively encorporate `stoicism` and practice `zen` meditations. some of my side projects can be found here on github, where I tinker with various side quests.

Linux is my first love (Ubuntu, my most favorite distro in particular), but macOS is currently my daily driver on my personal machines. I hate Windows with all the cells of my being (but I have to use it for work _vomit emoji_); Windows 8.1 is the last good version of Windows.

Anyway, heres a link I guess to my website: [stoicswe.com](https://www.stoicswe.com), if you so desire to parse it over.
