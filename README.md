senior software wngineer, currently working at GE Digital. I have skills and most experience working on `distributed microservices` running in `kubernetes` clusters and `docker` containers. I am also desperately addicted to coffee (professionally, of course).

outside of the professional space: a privacy rights, OSS advocate, and an avid `star citizen` enthusiast. I can also be found playing `dnd`, `world of warcraft`, and `warhammer` (both total war and table top). additionally, I tend to read a number of books, mostly on philosophies and scifi (my favorite being `Dune`). some of my side projects can be found here on github.
