        "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will return the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

    Too often the world fears change and is slow in accepting change. It is,however, through change and restrospection that we learn more about ourselves and how to make the right changes in order to improve.
