Senior software engineer at GE Vernova, building a world that works everyday. I build and deploy critical Smart Electric Grid Software solutions, supporting the current electric grid optimizations and green energy deployments through micro service-based architectures. I have a strong passion and desire to build products that are critical to the everyday lives of the general public, despite whether the public is aware of it or not. 

The experience I have had at GE Vernova has consisted of building, deployment, and maintenance of high performance, micro-service systems, as well as product/architecture design. I also work heavily on product documentation both internal and externally facing. At GE Vernova, with my team, we strive to build the highest-quality reliable products with the coordination of our partners and customers.

In the long-term, my goal is to continue to grow, learn, and develop meaningful, quality products and solutions with a major focus on software architectural/solution design.

Currently, though I have direct experience with C++/Java as my primary languages, with additional working experience in Jenkins, Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes. I also often dabble with ECORE API modeling, with auto code generation for Java and C++ (e.g., Enterprise Architect), as well as Python and Go. In my free time, I succumb myself to Swift when I am feeling like I didn't have enough code for the day (and a hell of a lot of Bash scripting).
