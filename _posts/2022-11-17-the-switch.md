Making the migration to primarily using free open source software (FOSS) over closed source products has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. It has not come without its challenges, by any means, but it's much more doable today than it was even a few years ago. The switch brings not only a sense of peace, knowing that the software I am using was sustainably built and maintained but also comfort knowing that the software I am using is respects my privacy.

Not everyone needs to make the switch to open source software. It's not a lifestyle for everyone. If you're curious about giving it a shot, however, I would greatly encourage it! Start small. Make small, incremental steps. Eventually, you'll find yourself an OSS guru. 

## Where to start?

> "The switch to daily driving open source software, does not need to be done with a head-first approach. You don't need to drown yourself in OSS too early...you'll only regret it later."

That's what I would have told myself years ago on my open source journey. I was wreckless, diving headfirst, and trying to change up too much at once. When I would choose to "try open source again" I would dive headfirst, erase my Windows drive(s), slap a Linux distro in there, and (re)set-up my laptop and software only to find myself lacking the motivation and determination to stick with my new found home due to the random maintenance or bug that would come up.

_Don't do what I did._

Instead of diving headfirst (unless that's how you roll of course), take the time to seek out open source alternatives to some of your daily apps that you use day to day. Maybe find an open source email client, webbrowser, image editor, or word processor. Try it out. Get a feel for it. See what you think. Once you've done that, try replacing another piece of software...then another...then another... Before long, you'll notice something about yourself, about your technology, and about your digital lifestyle: it'll be a higher percentage driven by open source software!

## The Last Step

After making the gradual change and switch to open source software alternatives for some of your most used or favorite apps, the final step *should* be considering your OS. Now, there's nothing wrong with stopping at this point, to stick with the familiar, to not make the final jump. No judgment here. I did the same thing for many years before making the leap to Linux too!

There are many distributions of Linux, each with their own philosophy, focus, and style. Some Linux versions are geared more towards enthusiasts and some with a focus on simplicity. It truly depends on your focus, passion, and what interests you. Some of the distributions that I would recommend taking a look at can be found below. 

But if you've been interested in Linux, OSS, or just tired of big tech monopolies, I wish you all the luck on your open source adventure!
