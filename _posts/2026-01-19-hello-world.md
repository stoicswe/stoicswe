> Hello World.

## The Start.

Just like that, the terminal displayed the text: “Hello World.” To many, this was trivial, printing a simple string line by code to the terminal display. To me, however, this was a huge achievement, a project that took over a day to complete. Little did I know, though, that this very first computer program would kickstart a huge change. I only wish that the twelve year old me would have gotten to see who he’d become, who he’d grow up to be. There are often times where I will reflect on that, whether I have fulfilled that child’s dream.

To be honest, it all happened quite differently than I first pictured. As I sit down to right this first entry in a long time for this blog, I was wondering where to begin, what to write in the first entry. I have never really done “blogging” before, so this is new to me. There is a small bit of anxiety with writing this. Questions and thoughts race within my mind: what if I suck at this? Despite that feeling, I sit here at my computer typing away into a word processor and jotting down my thoughts into a (hopefully) cohesive combination of words. I joke often with friends that English isn’t my first language (its definitely Java), which I suppose is true in some sense, since most of my time alive is spent writing software.

## Why are we here?

So what is this entry about anyway? Well, I was reflecting on what I could put together to be my first blog entry in quite some time (technically, I made one before about switching to OSS for everything, but that was pretty meh). I came to the conclusion that maybe this first entry should be about where it all started and some of the facts learned along the way. This would be a piece about how I’d gotten interested in programming and how I got where I am today. In the future, most blog posts will draw from the perspective that I share, focusing on different topics… likely philosophical, but that is for another blog post.

The journey to becoming a professional in software development for me started back when I received my first computer. My Aunt (the cool aunt in my life), had gifted me a Powerbook G4. It worked well for a time, but sadly it was locked into Mac OSX Panther and couldn’t be updated to newer operating systems. My aunt had felt bad about that, so she gifted me a Dell Inspiron 1545. It was a modest computer, but that second laptop was the spark that I needed in order to begin that journey. It was while I was browsing the internet, I came across something about “programming for kids” through a software platform called SmallBasic. It was a simplified coding Language/IDE/Compiler designed to help teach kids how to code.

I spent a lot of time with SmallBasic. Through my elementary period, that is what I spent the majority of my time doing, besides playing video games with my siblings or making home videos with childhood friends. While I didn’t get super familiar with the graphics APIs that Small Basic provided… the terminal input and output was something I really enjoyed messing with and did mess around with often. Most of the programs written were simple, and all existed in one really big file (I know now, bad practice… but at the time I didn’t know better). That early childhood passion grew into a strong desire and eventually a dream when in high school my mother had gotten me a C# course book for home. I was one of them homeschool kids, so once I’d complete the required (albeit, boring) class work… it was straight to the computer for me to work on C# programs, much to the dismay of my parents who wanted me “off the time wasting computer.” It was during this period of time that two things happened. The first was reading Walter Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs” which was a very inspirational book that still has a strong effect on me today (that’s probably another article to be honest) and the second was the development of a dream: to become a computer programmer.

## Undergrad

This continued on for a time until undergrad. Where I grew up, there was a local SUNY community college that was down the street. For my associates, I chose Computer Science as my focus and worked towards that degree. I graduated with honors in 2017, accomplishing an Associates of Computer Science. As part of my time there, I worked on the side as a Website Developer/Designer, setting up websites for various customers that were local to me. I built three or four websites, based on Wordpress with some heavy customizations, and sold them to the customers that wanted a custom website. It didn’t pay a ton, but it did get me just enough money to afford my very first cell phone: an iPhone 5s (I loved that phone for a long time, up until the battery gave out).

From there, I transferred to Houghton University (at the time it was called Houghton College). To be honest with you, I don’t really know the difference between a “University” and a “College” but I have to say, “University” does sound better when spoken or written on paper. Anyway, it was at Houghton University where I studied for my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, with a focus study on Quantum Computing. I did write a thesis as part of that study, but it did not end up getting published due to the time crunch at the end of my degree so I was unable to get a more refined document suitable for publishing. Reading back now on that paper, there are some significant changes I would want to make grammatically and just with the flow of the work, I can see why it was not publishable.

The studies at Houghton ended with a Bachelors, graduating with Honors, and hearing back from a corporation that I had interviewed with a couple of months prior to my graduation. It was in April of that year, I had started reaching out to various corporations and businesses, seeking a job as a Junior Developer. I was not expecting much, honestly I was thinking that maybe I would end up searching for longer post-degree. I tried for Google and didn’t make it past the second interview (I was too nervous during the coding section), I tried for Microsoft, but after the first interview I was not considered. I was going to try for Apple, but they didn’t have any junior positions at the time. I then tried for a company that I didn’t expect to ever try for: General Electric.

## Post-Graduation

The interviews for GE went fairly ok. I was not too confident with how they went, questioning whether I showed I had enough knowledge. It was not until a couple of weeks later that I received a phone call, with an offer for a position as a Junior developer, located in Florida. Now if you don’t know anything about Houghton, this university is located in the far northern region of New York, so the move to this job was going to be a long one. I thought about this, and accepted the position.

At the time, I didn’t know what I was getting into, but since my very first day in June, I have been working at GE ever since. It’s been nearly seven years now and I continue to live that dream that childhood me would be proud of I think. Though this didn’t go as I had first expected (in my childhood, I had dreamed specifically of Google, Microsoft, or Apple), I am glad I had taken the position that I did. The experience working at GE has been transformative to say the least, forcing the learning of new skills and expansion of domain knowledge with respect to electric grid operations. It’s not a perfect company by any means, but it is a very good corporation to work at.

As I near the end of this blog post, as a note to myself the important thing is to remember both how fortunate the series of events played out that got me here and there is still so much more to learn. The more I begin to reflect, the more I realize that I don’t know all that much, since the world is filled with so much knowledge, experiences, and opportunities to grow and develop into a better human being. As I reflect further, in depth, on this experience and what I’ve learned along the way, I am hopeful that maybe a little bit of hat I have learned and experienced could be helpful. I can’t promise the frequency of this blog, or the length of the entries, we will just have to feel it out as it goes.
